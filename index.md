     ```
     python main.py
     ```

2. **User Interface Overview**
   - After launching, you will see a user-friendly interface to select your filtering method.
   - Choose between IIR Butterworth Zero-Phase and SMA/EMA for your time series analysis.

3. **Load Your Data**
   - Click on the "Load Data" button and select your synthetic dataset from your files.
   - Ensure the data is in CSV format with the first column as time and subsequent columns as values.

4. **Run the Benchmark**
   - Once your data is loaded, click the "Run Benchmark" button.
   - The application will compute results and display them actively for comparison.

### 📈 Features

- **Comparison of Methods:** View side-by-side comparisons of IIR Butterworth Zero-Phase and SMA/EMA.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use with no programming experience required.
- **Customization Options:** Users can adjust parameters for both filtering methods to meet specific needs.
